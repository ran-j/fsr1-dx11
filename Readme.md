# Simple FSR 1 for Directx 11
This is a simple implementation of FSR 1.0 for Directx 11. The implementation is based on the Directx 11 API and uses the Compute Shader to perform the upscaling. The implementation is very simple and is intended to be used as a starting point for developers who want to integrate FSR 1.0 into their Directx 11 applications.

# How to use
The implementation is very simple and can be integrated into any Directx 11 application. The implementation consists of one main classe: `SimpleFSR1`. The class is responsible for creating the Directx 11 resources and calling the compute shader to perform the upscaling.

To use the implementation, you need to create an instance of the `SimpleFSR1` class and call the `Upscale` method to perform the upscaling.
